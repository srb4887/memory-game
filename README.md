## How to play
Click on a card to reveal the symbol on it.  Click on a second card to reveal that card's symbol.  If it's a match, they will both turn green, increase in size, and then return to their original size.  If they are not a match, they will both turn red, move side to side, and then return to their original position.

Once all 8 pairs of cards have been matched, you win!  You'll be told how many pairs you tried to match and how long it took you to win.  You will also be given a star rating from 1 (the worst) to 3 (the best) based on how many match attempts it took you.

At any point of the game, you can click the reset button to start over.

Have fun!
